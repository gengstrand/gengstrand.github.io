<p>Coders come in two flavors, those who use a simple text editor and those who code with a full featured IDE or Integrated Development Environment. An IDE does a lot more than edit text files. Building, packaging, dependency management, refactoring, and code generation are just some of the additional functionality that typically comes with an IDE. Modern IDEs also reach into more phases of software development including requirements, analysis,&nbsp; debugging, and deployment.</p>
<p>There are many IDEs that are available including Visual Studio and NetBeans; however, the IDE that I want to talk about today is Eclipse. Originally IBM's replacement for the atrocity known as Visual Age for Java, <a title="Eclipse.org Home" href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> has grown into a highly pluggable IDE for just about any software development language and platform.</p>
<p>It's that high pluggability that makes Eclipse so special. That and the rich marketplace of freely available, high quality plugins that can be surfaced within Eclipse. Here are some of the plugins that I use on my home machine.</p>
<p>There are lots of plugins for Eclipse and it would be hard to set up just what you needed if you started with a blank Eclipse, just the shell with no plugins. That's OK because there are lots of convenient packagings of plugins for you to start from. Some of the best packages feature eclipse for <a title="Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/heliosr" target="_self">Java developers</a>, <a title="Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/heliosr" target="_self">J2EE developers</a>, <a title="Eclipse for PHP Developers" href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-php-developers/heliosr" target="_self">PHP developers</a>, <a title="Eclipse CDT" href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/" target="_self">C++ developers</a>, and <a title="Eclipse Modeling Tools" href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools-includes-incubating-components/heliosr" target="_self">modelers</a>. Web developers might want to take a look at <a title="Aptana" href="http://www.aptana.com/" target="_self">Aptana</a>, especially if you do Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>The good blog is that you can mix and match. You can have multiple versions of Eclipse that you can enhance with additional plugins. I could have both the JDT and the PDT running as two separate instances of Eclipse or I could just install the <a title="PHPEclipse" href="http://www.phpeclipse.com/" target="_self">PHPEclipse</a> plugin into the JDT. Why pick one over the other? Use PDT if you are a full time PHP developer and pick PHPEclipse if you mostly do Java and just need to do a little PHP coding every now and then.</p>
<p>If you find that EMT is overkill for your design needs, then check out the Eclipse plugin for <a title="Free UML Tool for Fast UML Diagrams" href="http://www.umlet.com/" target="_self">UMLet</a>.</p>
<p>Another favorite plugin of mine is <a title="Pydev" href="http://pydev.org/" target="_self">Pydev</a> which is helpful for Python or Django developers.</p>
<p>Not only are there plugins for different development languages, there are also plugins for different frameworks. The Eclipse plugins for <a title="DataNucleus Access Platform - Eclipse Tutorial" href="http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/guides/eclipse/index.html" target="_self">JDO</a>, <a title="SpringSource Tool Suite" href="http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts" target="_self">Spring</a>, <a title="Google Plugin for Eclipse" href="http://code.google.com/eclipse/" target="_self">GWT, and GAE</a> are some of my favorite in this category.</p>
<p>Eclipse plugins are also very helpful for more code related activities than just coding. <a title="subclipse.tigrase.org" href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/" target="_self">Subclipse</a> is a full featured plugin to interface with the <a title="Apache Subversion" href="http://subversion.apache.org/" target="_self">Subversion</a> control system. <a title="m2eclipse: Project Home" href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/" target="_self">M2Eclipse</a> allows Eclipse developers to easily build their projects and manage their project dependencies using <a title="Apache Maven" href="http://maven.apache.org/" target="_self">Maven2</a>. With <a title="Mylyn: Code at the Speed of Thought" href="http://www.tasktop.com/mylyn/" target="_self">Mylyn</a>, you can access and keep track of your list of development tasks right within the Eclipse GUI. There are a lot of Mylyn connectors for various project management tools including <a title="Free Rally Project Management" href="http://www.rallydev.com/agile_products/editions/community" target="_self">Rally</a>, <a title="CollabNet TeamForge" href="http://www.collab.net/products/ctf/" target="_self">CollabNet TeamForge</a>, <a title="FogBugz - Bug &amp; Issue Tracking, Project Management, Help Desk Software" href="http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/" target="_self">FogBugz</a>, and <a title="The Trac Project" href="http://trac.edgewall.org/" target="_self">Trac</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a coder who prefers using an IDE, then consider Eclipse for its wealth of plugins that span a wide variety of languages, frameworks, and methodologies.</p>
