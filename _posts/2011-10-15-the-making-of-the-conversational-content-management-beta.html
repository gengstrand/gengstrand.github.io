excerpt: With online collaboration such as Google Apps, the users get no clear clues
  as to who to authoring now. There is a chat area where participants can discuss
  the content but it does not directly become the content itself. With CCM, the content
  authoring medium is basically a chat room. People discuss the topic and a chat reporter
  records the conversations then distills it down to an actionable summary.

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Maybe it is just the inner entrepreneur but I really enjoy getting to explore an innovative idea and bringing it to the light of day. That was perhaps the main reason why I enjoyed working on the Conversational Content Management beta so much.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">What was innovative about this project was in the way that the collaboration problem was addressed. In most online collaborative document creation environments, the actual editing is the visual equivalent to what was used to be called half duplex. If you move the mouse and started typing, then you rudely took away control from whoever was editing last. This has a very chilling effect on the fragile process of group creative interaction.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Have you ever served on a board of directors? The monthly board meeting usually looks like this. A group of people discuss the agenda while an assistant takes notes. Later on, the highlights (i.e. the actionable summary) get published.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">What if you could have access to that assistant in any meeting? That is what the Conversational Content Management beta is all about. All collaboration is done in the chat room itself. A robot records the entire conversation and extracts out the actionable summary later. The following technical white paper discusses how and introduces the following open source projects used to create this beta and accelerate its time to market.</div>
