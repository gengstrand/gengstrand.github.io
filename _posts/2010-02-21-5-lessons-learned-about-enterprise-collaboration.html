<p>The <a title="Visualizing Social Software and Colllaboration Marketplace" href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Blog/1659-Social-Software-Collaboration-Marketplace-2009" target="_self">enterprise collaboration space is heating up</a>. Sometimes called Enterprise 2.0 and sometimes called social media, a lot of executives and key decision makers are <a title="Enterprise 2.0" href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/future-of-work/enterprise-20-conference-aftermath-32715" target="_self">attending conferences</a> about collaboration. <a title="Harnessing the Collective" href="http://ploneglenn.blogspot.com/2009/03/harnessing-collective.html" target="_self">High profile think tanks</a> are starting to advocate for the enterprise to get social. Even <a title="Social Workers" href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/future-of-work/social-workers-33620" target="_self">mainstream companies</a> are starting to see compelling value in adding more collaboration to their portals. Collaboration is also starting to gain more positive <a title="Era of Collective Wisdom" href="http://ploneglenn.blogspot.com/2009/02/era-of-collective-wisdom.html" target="_self">traction in the press</a>, too.</p>
<p>So, don't be surprised if that announcement of a new company wide collaboration initiative hits your corporate in-box one day soon.&nbsp; Architects, project leaders, and knowledge workers need to prepare for that day. Here are 5 lessons learned from a software vendor with two collaboration products already released and a third one on the way.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stand on the shoulders of giants</strong>. Study those companies who have gone down this road before you and have <a title="Decentralized Decision Making" href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/future-of-work/decentralized-decision-making-31954" target="_self">succeeded in their efforts at enterprise collaboration</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Be prepared to change the way you do business</strong>. Chances are that your organization will have to <a title="One Ingredient to Successful Innovation is Internal Change" href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/future-of-work/one-ingredient-to-successful-innovation-is-internal-change-33225" target="_self">change some of its behaviors</a> in order to really reap the full benefits of enterprise collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Increase your collective IQ</strong>. Get smart about collaboration by <a title="Mapping the Genome of Collective Intelligence" href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/future-of-work/mapping-the-genome-of-collective-intelligence-33978" target="_self">harvesting the knowledge</a> that such activity can yield.</li>
<li><strong>Email is your enemy and your friend.</strong> There is going to be this <a title="5 Reasons Why You Should Stop Using Email to Collaborate" href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/future-of-work/5-reasons-why-you-should-stop-using-email-to-collaborate-34094" target="_self">love/hate relationship with email</a>. People are habituated to using email so it is a really effective touch point for re-engagement; however, email is not very effective when collaborating over documents or engaging in collective decision making.</li>
<li><strong>Get flat</strong>. Companies with a <a title="Flat Enterprise Society" href="http://ploneglenn.blogspot.com/2010/01/flat-enterprise-society.html" target="_self">flatter organizational structure</a> tend to benefit more from enterprise collaboration than those companies whose org charts look like the Eiffel Tower.</li>
</ol>
